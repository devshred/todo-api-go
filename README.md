# Todo-API based on Go
This project uses [Go](https://go.dev/) with [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) and [GORM](https://gorm.io/) to provide a simple todo-app API and is used for workshops.
It implements an [OpenAPI spec](src/main/resources/todo-spec.yaml) and can be tested with a [frontend based on Vue.js](https://github.com/devshred/todo-web).

## how-to run

docker compose up
```
